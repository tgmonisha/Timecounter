# Timecounter
In My project the following datastrucures are used

Tkinter Widgets:
Labels (Label): Used for displaying text on the GUI, such as the timer, current time, and file paths.
Entry (Entry): Used for taking user input for hours, minutes, and seconds in the timer.
Button (Button): Used for creating clickable buttons that trigger functions like starting the timer or setting preset times.
StringVar (StringVar): Used to store and manipulate the values entered in the Entry widgets.
Standard Python Data Types:

Strings: Used for specifying file paths, labels, and various text throughout the code.
Integers: Used for numerical calculations, such as calculating the total time in seconds for the timer.
Lists:

Image buttons are created using the PhotoImage class, and instances of these buttons are stored in a list ([button1, button2, button3]) for convenient placement on the GUI.
Threading:

The threading module is implicitly used when the Timer function is called to update the timer in the background while the GUI remains responsive.
## Project Explanation:
This code represents a simple timer application with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library in Python. The program allows users to set a countdown timer and provides preset options for different timer durations related to activities such as brushing, facing, and cooking eggs. Here's a breakdown of the main features:

Timer Display:

The GUI displays a clock showing the current time and provides fields for entering hours, minutes, and seconds for the timer.
Preset Timer Options:

Preset buttons (brush, face, eggs) allow users to quickly set predefined timer values without manually entering them.
Start Button:

The "Start" button triggers the timer countdown based on the user-entered or preset values.
Countdown Sound:

When the timer reaches zero, it plays a sound using the playsound library. The sound file used for the countdown is "Countdown Music.wav."
File Path Display:

The GUI displays the full file paths for image files ("brush.png," "face.png," "eggs.png") and the audio file ("Countdown Music.wav") using Label widgets.
Threading for Timer:

The timer runs in the background using the threading module to keep the GUI responsive during countdown.
Responsive Design:

The GUI is designed with a fixed size (400x600) and a black background (#000), giving it a visually appealing and responsive layout.
Overall, this code creates a user-friendly timer application with preset options for common activities, providing both visual and auditory cues to the user. Users can customize the timer or quickly start preset timers for specific tasks.
